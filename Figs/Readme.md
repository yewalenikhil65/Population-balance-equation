- **1** **comparison_with_analyticalSol.png** - This shows comparsion of solving PBE using jump process solvers with analytical solution obtained from method of scotts.
- **2** **benchmarking_PBE.png** - This shows how `RSSA` and `RSSACR` outperforms other Jump algorithms for solving PBE stochastically.
